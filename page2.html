      <p>This year's pentathalon much like last years consisted of all denver public school's JROTC's.
        In this competition, we had 2 teams, Team 1 consisted of Marcos Bonilla, Edgar Reyes, Oscar Rodriguez, Andrea Medina, Kaitlyn Rodriguez, and Laura Salarez. As of for Team 2, it consisted of, Deon Cdbec, Jose Rojas, Josue Mercado, Ivana Gamez, Yamilet Olivas, and Laura Banuelos.
        These cadets competed in this event and did absolutely outsanding.
        Make sure to congragulate them for their efforts. They placed second and that's amazing, although it might not be first, we'll get them next year.
